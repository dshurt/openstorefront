<p>Only feature not support with mongo is the database export and import via the system archive feature.  </p>",,,"Pre-Deploy Instructions
--------------------------

Config to use an existing mongo installation.  **Mongo must be setup/installed separately from the application** (Version 4.0.x should be compatible)

Make sure the user assigned to the Storefront Application has permission to create databases and create/drop collections.  (By default Mongo is not setup with user security.  However, for production environments the security should be setup.)

1. Edit /var/openstorefront/config/openstorefront.properties

Add/edit the following properties:
	
db.use.mongo=true
mongo.connection.url=<example mongodb://localhost:27017 this is needs to be set to mongo instance to use;  make sure the port is accessible to storefront application server> 

For connection URLs see below to set up a connect that requires an user/password
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/
http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.9/driver/tutorials/connect-to-mongodb/



Deployment
-------------

      Application
      -------------

      copy openstorefront.war (from https://github.com/di2e/openstorefront/releases/download/v2.8.0/openstorefront.war ) to 
      /usr/local/tomcat/latest/webapps 

 
      Data Migration
       ----------------
       (This takes about 1-2 minutes; the application will be un)
       The data migration will happen automatically when the application starts; if configured to use mongo and there exists an existing orient installation. 

       Orient will start / stop during the transfer process (Automatic).  Orient's data is NOT modify and is read and stored back in mongo

       This will create a database in Mongo (by default ""storefront"") and then it will put all collections under that.
       (see http://di2e.github.io/openstorefront/systemadmin/versionmigrationguide/ for more information on the migration)



Post-Deploy Instructions
---------------------------

Nothing to do.  


Rollback (if needed)
---------------------
Two options:

1. Deploy the old release 2.7.4.2 it will switch back to Orient and use the data prior to the data migration

or

2.  Change the configuration:

a. Edit /var/openstorefront/config/openstorefront.properties 

change  db.use.mongo=false  (from true to false) it will switch back to Orient and use the data prior to the data migration.  However, in this case the 2.8 changes will still be in place.

1.  I went through in Attributes -> Manage Assignments (Entry Assignments) by the way we need to change the button Entry Assignments to match the Window Title Manage Assignments

2.  So from here you can see that I have previously assigned DI2E Dist B to the _Size of ""big"".  It should be noted that currently DI2E Dist B (Entry) is of Entry Type *DI2E Component*.  Do we want to even _allow_ assigning if it is not of an Entry Type that has the _Size attribute assigned to it?

3.  Now back in Entries I try to change DI2E Dist B from the Entry Type DI2E Component to *Apple.*

*!image-2018-04-24-15-30-22-496.png!*

 

However, when I do this, I would expect that the REQUIRED Field of Size would be pre-filled with *big,* but it is not.

Tip: If you just want ""true""/""false"" result as you are generting computer-language output, use ""?c"", like ${myBool?c}.
----
Tip: You can write myBool?string('yes', 'no') and like to specify boolean formatting in place.
----
Tip: If you need the same two values on most places, the programmers should set the ""boolean_format"" setting to something like ""yes,no"".

You mentioned in your email “recently published”.  I don’t see that on the page.  Is that same as “recently completed evaluation”.  Words don’t match in my mind, publish can happen without evaluation (should be happening before evaluation as good data is available, such as description and POC info). 

 

Of course, wouldn’t be myself without a couple comments:
 * I don’t like the collapsed by Alphabet.  Two reasons, first I just want to scroll and not need to open 26 tabs.  Second, and more important, if I use the browser built in function to “find on page” if the word I’m searching for is under a collapsed tab, it won’t find it.
 ** Expand by default.
 ** 
 * 2^nd^ table is recently completed evaluation, suggest the title of the 4^th^ column to be Evaluation Completed Date (vice last updated)
 ** Label change
 ** 
 * For those that don’t have evaluation status, they should.  I think every asset should have a status tied to JIRA (I know you haven’t kept the integrations current Stan, but need to do so).  Even without integration, every asset should have a status.  I’m assuming you are using the DI2E Intent attribute for this?
 ** Discuss with Dave
 ** 
 * I think the page should have something on it explaining what it is.  A paragraph or 2.  Maybe a link to SF.  Maybe directions on how to get a project listed?
 ** just use static page in-front.
 ** 
 * I could go with a “recently added” table for new entries, to go with recently updated and recently completed evaluation. 
 ** add table
 * Can you split where the table goes?  I could see the 2 (or 3) smaller tables ending up on the DI2E Framework landing page (or maybe a subset of those tables with just the entry name…)
 ** This would be take quite a bit of dev work to ""inject"" or partially automated an existing page.  Do able but, 
 * And as discussed, we need to get the data that was in the old pages either linked here, or added to the SF.  The old evaluation data.""
 ** Keep the old evals as is in confluence with link to SF.  If the eval is new or updating then can be done in the SF.

So, Given this the admin could assign evaluatordude1 to evaluate something he or she has no access to and they would be confused when they can't see the evaluation.

We need to generally, across the site, make it more obvious when we have data sensitivity and data access.

However, for this particular case, it would be nice if, when assigning a user an evaluation, you only see (when eval/ entry is selected) the evals that that user has access to.

A filtered list would be very nice here and would avoid assigning an eval to a user that they cannot see with their current permissions.
