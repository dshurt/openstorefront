So you've heard that SPOONsite, is a free, effective way to advertise your small satalite part to the entire areospace industry - but, your marketing team has already made a glossy flyer of your spacecraft component with all the specs intractiably placed on the PDF file, or your engineering team just gave you a highly technical Excel worksheet, and you have 10 parts you wanted to upload to SPOON. You simply don't have time to hand enter all this information into the system, and besides, it's a real boring way to spend time you'd rather spend making rockets. 

Fortunately, you can now bulk upload any kind of file directly to SPOON, and SPOON's administrators will enter your setup SPOON part entries for you!
