SPOON site is a free, effective way to advertise your small satellite part to the entire areospace industry. However, if you have multiple parts to upload to the site, it is now possible upload your parts in bulk. Whatever files you have that contain parts information, whether that be and Excel spreadsheet, CSV file, or PDF file, through SPOON they can be uploaded and multiple parts deployed on SPOON simulatenously. Workers at SPOON will read your uploaded files and manually create Entries on SPOON based on the information in the files. You will review Entries created this way to ensure that the information was uploaded correctly and is to your liking, before submitting the Entries to be published on SPOON.


**tl;dr** - You can now bulk upload any kind of file directly to SPOON, and workers at SPOON will enter your setup SPOON part entries for you.
