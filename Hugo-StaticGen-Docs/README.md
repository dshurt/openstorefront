# Open Storefront Documentation

This documentation is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static website generator.

To install Hugo follow the directions [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) or download the latest release and put it in your path. [here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases).

The theme used for this documentation is [DocDock](http://docdock.netlify.com). Refer to the DocDock documentation for information on the theme such as shortcodes available, configuration, and site organization.

## How to Write Documentation

The files to edit are found in `openstorefront/Hugo-StaticGen-Docs/content`. Hugo uses this content to generate the website.

You have two flavors of markdown available provided by Hugo: standard github style markdown and [mmark](https://github.com/miekg/mmark/wiki/Syntax). To use mmark create a file with the `.mmark` extension or specify `markup = "mmark"` in the toml front matter of the markdown file. Mmark adds several features such as figures, citations, and different ordered list styles (i.e. 1,2,3 or a,b,c or A,B,C).

Images should be placed in `openstorefront/Hugo-StaticGen-Docs/static/images`. When you reference an image in the markdown file use the relative path for example `![My Image](/images/some-image.png)`.

If creating a new page use the Hugo cli with `hugo new path/to/new-doc.md` and Hugo will generate a new file with front matter at the specified path.

## Development Environment

The latest version of Hugo to work with the DocDock theme is v0.49.2. Download Hugo on the releases page https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.49.2 and add the binary to your path.

Hugo provides a live development server for viewing changes as you are editing the files. Go to `openstorefront/Hugo-StaticGen-Docs/` and run `hugo server --baseURL localhost:1313 --watch`. This will run a local dev server at `localhost:1313`, any changes made to the files will trigger a rebuild and refresh your browser.

## How to build the Documentation

The latest release of Hugo to work with the theme is v0.49.2. Get it at https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.49.2

This should only be done once per release.  For Development use `hugo server -b localhost:1313 -w` which will run a live reloading development server. To see perform a build run `hugo` from `openstorefront/Hugo-StaticGen-Docs/` which will build to the `./build` by default which is in the gitignore.

To deploy the docs to github do the following:

1. Delete docs folder at `openstorefront/docs/`

2. In the terminal go to `openstorefront/Hugo-StaticGen-Docs/` and run `hugo -d ../docs`. This will build the website in `openstorefront/docs`. The build can then be committed and merged to the release.
